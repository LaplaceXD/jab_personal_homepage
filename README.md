# JAB Personal Homepage

This is just a personal site made in compliance for our CIS 1202 prefinals. It was quite fun making this site, since I made use of OOP principles in both `php` and `javascript`. Although, I did cram the process in making this site, but I still did my best to deliver my best effort in making my vision come true. 

## Techstack

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- PHP

## Note

- No libraries were used in this project, although, we were allowed to use them. I just wanted to make sure that I'm maximizing my learning and knowledge on this project thus I imposed a no libary rule.
